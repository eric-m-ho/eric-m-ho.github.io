I am a Lecturer at UCLA. I received my PhD from the Department of Education (Social Research Methodology division) at the UCLA School of Education and Information Studies. I was advised by Professor Minjeong Jeon and Professor Noreen Webb.

As a quantitative methodologist, I am interested in the development and application of quantitative tools for educational research and policy analysis. My current research interests include causal inference, multilevel modeling, latent space modeling, and the application of data science tools in educational research.

I have worked as a researcher, data analyst, and consultant for various educational organizations such as the Los Angeles Unified School District, the American Institutes for Research, and the Alliance College-Ready Public Schools. I graduated cum laude and with departmental honors from Columbia University with a major in data science and special concentration in educational studies.

I am currently open to research collaborations and opportunities as well as contract work. Please do not hesitate to contact me at ericmho [at] ucla [dot] edu
