I am a doctoral student in the Social Research Methodology division in the Department of Education at the UCLA School of Education and Information Studies. I am advised by Dr. Minjeong Jeon and Dr. Noreen Webb.

As a quantitative methodologist, I am interested in the development and application of quantitative tools for educational research and policy analysis. My current research interests include causal inference, multilevel modeling, latent space modeling, and the application of data science tools in educational research.

I have worked as a data analyst and consultant for various educational organizations such as the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Alliance College-Ready Public Schools. I graduated cum laude and with departmental honors from Columbia University with a major in data science and special concentration in educational studies.

I am currently open to research collaborations and opportunities as well as contract work. Please do not hesitate to contact me at ericmho [at] ucla [dot] edu
