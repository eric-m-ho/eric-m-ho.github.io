title: "New publication: Interaction map: A visualization tool for personalized learning based on assessment data"
---

With my advisor Professor Minjeong Jeon, I have published an article in *Psych* based on my dissertation. You can read our work [here](https://doi.org/10.3390/psych5040076). In this manuscript, we describe practical extensions of the latent space item response model, including a bubble chart to display respondent and item main effects and student profiles. We present a [Shiny application](https://ohrice.shinyapps.io/LatentSpace/) which allows users to upload their own assessment data and view the bubble charts and student profiles. Feel free to check out our paper and the tool!
