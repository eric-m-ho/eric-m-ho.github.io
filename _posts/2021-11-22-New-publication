title: "New publication: Evaluation of the mHealth Training Institutes"
---

For the past year or so, I have worked with my advisor Professor Minjeong Jeon, fellow labmates, and researchers from UCLA and Northwestern University to 
evaluate the [mHealth Training Institutes](https://mhti.md2k.org/) (mHTI). We focused on the social network data in the 2017-2019 mHTIs to understand whether 
interdisciplinary conversations were more likely to persist or form throughout the Institutes. You can read about our work [here](doi.org/10.1017/cts.2021.859).
