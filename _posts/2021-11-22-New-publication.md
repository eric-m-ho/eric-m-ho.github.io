title: "New publication: Evaluation of the mHealth Training Institutes"
---

For the past year or so, I have worked with my advisor Professor Minjeong Jeon, fellow labmates, and researchers from UCLA and Northwestern University to 
evaluate the [mHealth Training Institutes](https://mhti.md2k.org/) (mHTI). One of the main goals of the mHTIs is to foster more interdisciplinary dialogue and conversations. 
We focused on social network data in the 2017-2019 mHTIs to understand whether 
certain kinds of conversations were more likely to persist or form throughout the Institutes. To do so, we applied temporal exponential random graph models (TERGMs) to 
analyze these patterns.
