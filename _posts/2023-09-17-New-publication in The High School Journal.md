title: "New publication: Towards hierarchical cluster analysis heatmaps as visual data analysis of entire student cohort longitudinal trajectories and outcomes from Grade 9 through college"
---

It's been a long time coming (I have been working on this project since my undergraduate days), but I'm happy to announce that along with Professor Alex J. Bowers of Teachers College, Columbia University, and Yihan Zhao, we have published our article in *The High School Journal*! You can read our work [here](https://doi.org/10.1353/hsj.2022.a906700). In this manuscript, we discuss the power of data visualization, specifically hierarchical cluster analysis heatmaps, in displaying the longitudinal journeys of students through secondary school. We believe that there is great promise in our approach in seeing which students may be at-risk in terms of poor grades and other indicators. My contribution to this project is a [Shiny application](https://ohrice.shinyapps.io/Heatmap) I created which allows users to upload their own data (in a specified format) and view the heatmaps themselves. Feel free to check out our paper and the tool!
