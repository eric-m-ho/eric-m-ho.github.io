title: "New publication: Are teachers meeting studentsâ€™ needs in untracked science classrooms? Evidence based on a causal inferential approach"
---

With my former advisor Professor Minjeong Jeon and Professor Michael Seltzer, I have published an article in *PLoS ONE* based on my qualifying paper. You can read our work [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0300587). In this manuscript, we analyze PISA 2015 data to understand how tracking in schools may or may not affect how well teachers meet students' needs in science classrooms. We use multilevel models and sensitivity analyses to estimate causal effects. I had been working on this project for some time now, so it's great to finally see it get published!
