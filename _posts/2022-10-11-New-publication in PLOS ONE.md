title: "New publication: Relationships between changing communication networks and changing perceptions of psychological safety in a team science setting"
---

Along with my advisor Dr. Minjeong Jeon and collaborators from UCLA and Northwestern University, I evaluated the [mHealth Training Institutes](https://mhti.md2k.org/) (mHTI). One of the main goals of the mHTIs is to foster more interdisciplinary dialogue and conversations. 
We focused on social network data in the 2017-2019 mHTIs to understand whether 
certain kinds of conversations were more likely to persist or form throughout the Institutes. In our previous paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2021.859) we applied temporal exponential random graph models (TERGMs) to 
analyze these patterns. This time, we used stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOM) to investigate the relationships between communication networks and perceptions of team psychological safety.
